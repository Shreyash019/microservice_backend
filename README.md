# Microservice Boilerplate: Modular Development

This project provides a foundational structure for building applications using a microservice architecture. It promotes modularity, scalability, and maintainability by allowing you to create independent services for specific functionalities.

## Features:

Modular Services: Break down complex logic into smaller, well-defined services.
Scalability: Scale individual services based on their needs without impacting others.
Maintainability: Focus development and maintenance efforts on specific service areas.
